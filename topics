Anything that stands in the way of Love must step aside.


exploring love
--------------
- love is more important than anything that separates us
    The Christian meaning
    Dealing with being a hippie
        Love is not (just) emotion
            Love is action, words, and spirit 
- the test of love
- further exploration of the love test ((hopefully)it represents the Trinity of God)
- love in every action 


love and marriage
- Marriage is not to make you happy, it is to make you holy
- God is love
- God is the definition of holiness 
- Therefore, in any institution that God creates, at the core there must be love, most so in the a central institution that is at the roots of human existence. Whatever you decide to call it, whether formally experienced or not, over time humans desire and overwhelmingly chose to congregate as families.
- God is a family, the trinity
  - God is eternal
  - God's nature is unchanging
  - Love requires more than one person, or there is no one to love in the highest sense ((put verse here) "Love your God" and "love your neighbor as yourself" both come before "love yourself" which is the only completely natural form of fallen love).
  - Therefore if God is to be "Love", the source of love, or love itself, then he must have always have had someone to love 
  - Explanation of love as a the holy family of the Trinity
    - The Father, the Word, and the Spirit
    - Supernatural (as in "above" our natural existence) of one God being several persons and vice versa
    - God being in community.
  - The human marriage, and from that, the human family is designed to be holy, following the pattern of the holy trinity.
- Practical holiness: Every action that makes a "good marriage" fulfills *exactly* the definition of love given in the bible (love is kind, love is... (give verse) ). In exact and explicit terms: The better a marriage, the *holier* the marriage is. 
- Holiness, living in a state of love, is never *about* enjoyment. Enjoyment comes with it hand in hand, but it is *NOT* the core of holiness. Love is putting someone before yourself, making your choices based on bettering, supporting, working with, and just generally loving on someone else.
- Nothing is more satisfying. Nothing is harder. Nothing is worth more, compared to any accumulation of worldy treasures or grief.



Beliefs - Critical and non-critical
- as Christians we have historically and biblically held some beliefs as critical (We are saved by faith in Jesus alone) and non critical beliefs (particular expressions of moderation (how much is *too much* alcohol) 
- How we sometimes have trouble separating these beliefs and how much we value them.
- Personal anecdote of philosophical differences between Logan and I on the death of Jesus. 
  - Critical part: Jesus dying saved us from our sins
  - Non critical parts:
    - Did Jesus go to hell?
    - Was Jesus seperated from God during his death?
  - I felt mortally threatened that my own brother could have viewpoints that were so opposed to mine on these theological points. Only later did I realize that, while they are undoubtably important issues, they are not even in the same ballpark of importance as the critical point, that we are saved by faith in Jesus dying for our sins. 
- We are called to live in harmony, IN SPITE of possible differences of belief. "Unity on the important beliefs, grace on the minor beliefs" (need some verses)




your politics is not christianity
    - evil of opponent's politics
    - another persons evil is not an excuse to not love them
    - moral judgement is self judgement 
  - Bullying others based on their beliefs:
    - Is not Loving
    - Builds pride in our our "righteousness" by killing love for others
    - Our hope is in loving the unlovable, not in judgement. Before God we are all sinners, and no one, without salvation through Christ, is "righteous".



sexual sin 
    - Sexual sin's primary effect is to separate someone from God (spiritually). 
        - For some reason sexual sin pushes God out of mind and out of the habits of our soul
    - God loves you, no matter if you're gay or straight
      - 
    - The crux of the struggle, straight people sin by choice based on desire but there is an outlet that is not sin (marriage), but there is no outlet for gay people.
      - I need someone to speak truth and love into this section
    - blessing of being gay (blessed are the... )
        - Feelings and temptation is not sin, and those who obey are considered righteousness 
          - God loves you
        - God calls all Christians to be living sacrifices for him, to give up all that we are to become more like God.
        - Those who voluntarily give up sexuality is an honest and powerful way to show we stand for God 
        - the more we suffer, the more powerful our voice when we stand for love.
        - Giving up sexuality is not the only choice.
          - God does change us. This is part of faith, in the physical (dna), mental (conditioning), and spiritual.
          - God loves you, no matter who you are, what your struggle with.
        - THIS IS INCOMPLETE. (Lord please speak to me).
    - we need to love everyone actively, not just in words.
      - It is not enough to say we love people (or even not hate people).
      - We must fully apply love through words, through action, and through spirit or we are not loving them at all.



racism
    we are called to forgive our enemies
    we are called to pray for our enemies 
    No miracle cure, only recognizing when we're not Loving people (and a huge part of that is not being Charitable (see C.S. Lewis on Christian Virtue of charity))



fear of new beliefs (science, culture)
    - We must ask ourselves why we reject something. 
    - It is critical that we ask ourself this question. If we reject something other than for biblical reasons, are we doing it out of fear, rather than to further the Kingdom by standing against darkness? 
    - By rejecting beliefs other than biblical reasons we can do damage to the Kingdom by not loving people. This is the primary pitfal
    Are we rejecting something due to :
        1) Because it disagrees with our beliefs?
            - Does it actually disagree with our beliefs
            - Why are said beliefs so important to us?
              - Are said beliefs *critical beliefs*?
              - Are there multiple ways to view the same belief without corrupting it?
        2) Fear?
            - Are we afraid that conceeding to some argument or scientific argument/theory will corrupt our beliefs?
            - Can we examine to see if those fears are founded?
              - Are the beliefs actually threatened?
              - If beliefs are threatened are they actually threatened by other cultural beliefs attached to the issue in question?
              - Are the beliefs under threat critical beliefs?
        3) Pride?
            - Are we too proud to accept something new because it would be a "surrender" or showing that we or our "culture" is weak?
            - Do we feel that accepting an alien belief is ceeding to an "enemy"?
    - We are called to live in the world, but not be of the world.
      - I believe that means that we adapt to the world around us in order to love the people in it, without losing any core beliefs, and while carefully examining non-critical beliefs and their application.
    - One of the reasons I believe we tend to find it easier to reject new things is because we are afraid that by accepting wrongful beliefs we damn ourselves. The truth is, God forgives our sins (including wrongful beliefs), and is the one who we should care about. Unfortunately, by rejecting things unnecessarily we can (and do) build up walls between us and the people we are trying to save, hurting the very foundation and calling of the Kingdom of God. This is not good. 


Praying for our enemies
    - We are called to Love our enemies, carte blanche. No excuses

The stick in our eye (reckognizing we are full of sin, and that we must deal with that first before we can help another with theirs)

pride kills love (antithesis of love)
    Pride takes the same


---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Each chapter has a "Further Reading"


- Writing is succinct and simple, to reach more people and to improve clarity
- Make a habit of stopping well short of trying to prove the truth of any standpoint other than the the critical one: Anything that stands in the way of (God's) Love needs to move.
- Show fallacies through asking questions, attempt to limit proving a point at the end of an idea
