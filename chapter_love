The purpose of this chapter is to provide some basic definitions of love. While that may sound dry (or even a little dusty), it's absolutely necessary to define what we mean, because we are going to swimming in some very deep water. 

#TODO: add good example of a miscommunication in meaning
Any try to argue for something should have a section where we say what we *don't* mean. It's useless to talk about the importance of love if some person on the street thinks I'm talking about something completely different. 

When I say the word love I do not mean feelings of attraction. Those feelings are definitely a part of love, as I will talk about later. But liking someone is really only a small piece, perhaps the smallest piece of what it means to love someone.

Similarly, love is not feelings of happiness with someone. Feelings of happiness are definitely a huge product of loving someone, but again it is not the whole of the matter. To treat happiness as the fullness of love is to treat love as a wave in the ocean, a passing, ultimately tragic and, if truth be told, a fairly disheartening thing to base a life around.

Love is not merely being kind. Kindness is attached at the hip to love, but, if anything, it is subservient to it. Kindness may be a potent expression of love, but it is not *love* as a whole. One may be loving when they say a kind a word to a passing stranger in the street, but one misses the point of love if he doesn't recognize that that same kind person may go home and punish their children for misbehaving, and still be living out that love.

One criticism that people often express about 'love' as they know it, is its fugitive character. The word 'love' has taken on this air everywhere that it is a fleeting thing, a thing that you chase, an elusive bird. A thing that can be lost in the fog or evaporate like a dream. They say, as many feel, that everywhere the virtues and necessity of love are extolled, and never materialize. Men will cry from the rooftops for others to love each other in public, and will drive home and complain to their spouse about the greed of Wall Street, the ignorant pride of the opposing party, and the reckless stupidity of man. To them love is a platitude, a tool of sophists 

I say to you now, for those who really know love, it is nothing of the kind. Real love, acted out, is more like a rock upon which we can stand. Love promotes others, and helps them when they fall. Love is seen when a friend confronts a main about their crippling addiction. It is seen when a mother cares for her mentally disabled child. It is seen in the great and small, but most especially when people choose to sacrifice what is theirs to benefit another. What love is like is perhaps best described in 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 :

4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. 8 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.


And, like the words of Jesus of Nazereth, who's words will never pass away, love will never pass away. 

There is much more that can be said on the subject, but it is enough now that we can move forward.



What I have noticed is that whenever people listen to a deep teaching, it works best when they have pratical test to use to apply to themselves. So, even though we may have some idea what love is (and is not), it can be fairly useless if we don't have something to help reveal where it should be in our own lives.

My definition and test of love is that it most often requires three things at once:
1) love is words (communication)
2) love is action 
3) love is spirit


#define each piece 
# - Action: doing something to love someone (the actual action and effect)
# - Words: using words or action to express love (communication of love via words and actions)
# - Spirit: the sincerity of our feelings, determination and steadfastness of caring for others. Essentially, how others interpret *our* perspective on *them*

#TODO: how taking away any one of these three harms the nature of love, and in its worst case, stops being love at all. Examples include:
# - An impersonal, silent father giving gifts to his children 
# - A man expressing his love for someone, but who leaves when things get rough
# - A mother who cares for her children's physical needs and tells them she loves them but gets very angry/abusive if disobeyed (? this one needs improvement)

#TODO: 

Love is Words
-------------
This is the most obvious element of love this test recognizes. 99% of the time part of how we show we love someone is to tell them. As a trivial example, think of any romcom (romance comedy movie). The climax of a romantic movie is normally tied up with the title couple struggling to overcome their own issues in order say "I love you". 

Expressing love through words is often much more subtle in life. Asking someone who is hurting if they are okay, giving an unexpected compliment, and, yes casual declarations of love ("love you!") are much more common, and often, much more important in the long run. 

What is important to recognize is that telling someone you love them, no matter the technique or content, is *critical* to loving someone. 



Love is Action
--------------
Love with only words is like junk food. It feels great at first then makes you feel awful later. It is the secret at the heart of the one night stand. Words without backing actions are often worse than having said no words, they actually hurt the person you are trying to love. 

In a classical "working man" scenario, If I step inside my house after work, to tell my wife that I love her, then promptly walk past without a hug or kiss, step over the trash I've been meaning to take out for 4 days, eat dinner that she had prepared without more than a murmur with thanks, then watch tv to I fell asleep, I wouldn't be doing much in the way of communicating the "love" I expressed when I walked in. Granted, everyone who works has felt at some point like the "working man" in this example, and most housewives would understand that. But to make that pattern the habit of their life together is acidic to the meager words "I love you". And this is the conundrum that a whole category of married couples fall into, where love may have been why they came together but is slowly worn away by life. 

The critical piece here is that you absolutely must "water" any loving relationship. Love is not feeling, but the feelings surrounding love are built up by the constant, mutual actions (and words) of both parties. There is nothing inevitable about a marriage falling apart to the decays of time. Making something last is an active process. To be alive is to not give into decay, but to make our relationships flower through active maintenance.

This is why active patterns in a relationship are effective. Having date nights set aside so that a couple can grow their love. Choosing to always improve communication between you and your partner an absolute necessity. Choosing to act with restraint and patience when faced with ugly aspects of someone's nature. Choosing to equally confront the other person on such issue in a healthy way in order to fix the relationship, *NOT* to get revenge. 



Love is Spirit
-------------- 
This is the hardest piece of the love test to define. Basically, to express love with your spirit is to *mean* what you do or say when you are doing a loving action. Simple things like body language, tone, past experiences all play a *huge* role in telling the other person of your honesty when you love them.

It can be difficult to describe loving someone in your spirit, it is much easier to describe when someone is not loving in spirit. 

Some examples of loving words/actions without a loving spirit:
- A divorced parent who buys gifts for their children but does not visit them, or seems to avoid spending time with them
- Taking out the trash as part of your chores, but being obviously unhappy about its
- Telling your loved one that you love them, but don't express that love in other ways, like keeping the house clean even when it means a lot to other person.

These are some simple examples of expressing love in one way, but undermining it by having an unloving spirit. Of the 3 elements of this love test, this is probably the *most* important. Doing a loving action or saying loving words actually create far more pain than not saying them at all if the other person feels or thinks that you don't mean it. To love someone is love them and *mean* it. In fact, where it possible, loving only in with your spirit would be sufficient to fully express love for a person. "loving in spirit" is the only essential part of loving someone. Any amount of words or actions, in any proportion or style, hinge upon whether they communicate to the other person that you mean what you say or do. 

To love, you have to mean it. Anything short is not love.




A general goal throughout this book is to examine situations via all three aspects of this love test. More importantly, it will ask you to examine situations in your own life with this test. We want to always ask ourselves in any situation, are we loving someone with our words, loving someone with our actions, AND loving someone with our spirit?


An illustration:
----------------
Imagine a man walking down a city street late in the afternoon. He is carrying a laptop satchel, and wearing regular office attire. Our imaginary man, Jeb, is in his mid 40's, light haired, partially balding, moderately heavy set. Jeb, like most others his age, is busy with the rigors of working life, and blessed with the rigors of 2 sassy, insufferable preteen daughters. Jeb is an office manager at a satellite center for a major shipping company, where Jeb has been struggling to promote a healthier bottom line after two straight deficit quarters. Jeb is married to Caren, a social studies teacher at a local middle school.

Caren has been secretly struggling with depression after her mother died after struggling with advanced Alzheimers. Caren has taken to having too much wine with dinner and has been getting more distant while simultaneously spending more time watching Netflix every evening instead of talking.

Jeb is not consciously thinking about these things. Jeb's current concern is rushing to pick up the gift he bought from Amazon for his youngest daughter's 10th birthday, happening that evening. The gift, a new phone, the first his daugher will own, arrived broken the first time. After sending it back, Jeb and Caren missed the later delivery attempts, and its now being held for at the shipping center and only available for pickup for one hour.

While walking, rather more quickly that Jeb is used to, Jeb trips. The laptop flies out of his hands, hitting the laptop hard. Based on the cringe inducing cracking noise, Jeb is certain something has broken i n the machine. To top it off Jeb landed in a puddle and is now covered in muck. Jeb just sits there for a moment, struggling with the lemons life is handing him.

Another man walks up behind him. "Are you all right?" he asks, as he helps Jeb get up. "It's nothing," Jeb replies as he starts moving to get his things. "I got it," says the other man, who quickly gathers Jeb's things for him. 

"Where are you headed?" asks the man. 

"Uh, I'm going to the UPS distrobution center on Main. They're holding a package for me," replies Jeb.

"Ah, that's like half a mile from here. My car's in the lot next to us, I'll give you a ride," says the man.

"Uh, no I don't need..." 

"Don't worry about it. Everybody needs a leg up sometimes," the man says, smiling.

"Thanks," says Jeb, who feels a little of his burden lifting off his shoulders.





That's a whole lot of description for possibly the simplest random act of kindness a person can do for another. I want it to be clear in this illustration of the character's real personhood. But my secret motivation is this, to show how even in the simplest example, in the most normal examples of love that the test of action, words, and spirit can be exercised.

We see that the anonymous man shows love to Jeb through his actions: by helping him up, gathering his things, and giving him a ride. 

We see that the man shows Jeb through his words: asking if he's okay, insisting that he help him get his things, and giving the actual offer of the ride. 

We see that the man expresses a spirit of love: by stopping to help someone else without grumbling, to sacrifice time out of his own day happily, spending personal energy to conmfort another, giving a smile to someone who might need it. Any one of these aspects could be corrupted by letting personal inconvenience, stress or frustration get in the way, but in this example they reveal themselves to be truthful.



As we move onward throughout this book, we will carry this idea with us.
