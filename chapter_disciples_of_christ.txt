Made to love
------------

God's love, which theology often name's 'agape love', is love that does not depend or is changed by any positive feature of a person and is equally unihibited by any flaw in that person. It is the highest form of love, God's infinite love for mankind.

To my mind, seeing men in their full adulthood, it is of strange significance that our earliest love tends to be most similar to God's love than elsewhere in life. What I mean is, though children are the most selfish of creatures, they also love their parents without regard or reason. A child will love his mother even if he hates his mother. A son wants his father to be proud of him, because he loves his father, even if he does not know why. It manifests in our strange attachment to our parents, and often to a lesser degree, our siblings. We are physically wired to love, before any choice on the matter becomes apparent.

It is telling that, even when said parental love gives way to anger, that the child still wishes for their parents to look on him with kindness. Looking at it from above we can see that men are from their beginnings more closely in tune with God's love than with other kinds of love, as we love our parents without obvious need and often against reason. 

Of course, we all learn eventually that our parents are full of faults, and that those faults can hurt us. Furthermore, those around us are even more dangerous to trust, as others hurt us all too often. This is why virtually everyone alive has defensive emotional walls, learned in childhood, to defend against close attachment to others around us. Too often we can become so insulated, that we can no longer feel or develop deep love at all.


The Path of Loving my Neighbor
------------------------------
There is a common notion of "loving others" that is, simply stated, to love others who have done no physical or societal wrong against others, and to stand against those who would injure them. On the surface, this seems well and good, as it is simply the pleasure of enjoying the happiness of others in combination with justice against the wicked. The problem is, this belief is not enough to save the human soul. 

I do not just mean salvation from damnation into hell (which is true, but merely a sidenote here). What I mean is that such a thing is not love as God expresses it, and is not really love at all. It is simply learning to greater appreciate that which was already good and to condemn all that is already evil. How hard is it to love an already lovely thing?  How hard is it to hate what is already hateful? These are mere truisms, it does nothing to change us into better people at the core of our natures. 

Those who see the problem of evil desires hold a common few philosophies. The first, and the most childish in its cruelty, is to simply condemn the evil in this world and to destroy it. This belief is most commonly held by children, but I do not jest in saying this is the real emotional stance of many adult men and women. Unfortunately, and most often painfully, this simple idea is found inadequate, for all men carry evil in their souls. 

The more mature philosophical stance held is to believe in the *idea* of love and justice, that we must encourage people to make the choice to love and not to hate. To attempt to uphold what they think good, to fight what they think bad, and to encourage growth of their philosophy so the good may grow and the bad may wane. This is the ultimate plateau that most non-Christian thinkers live on. However, there is one momentous flaw that this philosophy cannot fix, that it cannot change the human soul. 

It may encourage increased natural feelings of happiness and care for others. But it does not change a man's most basic drives. At most, this notion of 'loving others while bringing justice against evil' provides a weapon, shame, to curb the most egregious social behavior by clubbing people with words. It does not overcome the selfish things that drive him: lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy, pride. It merely curbs the worst offenses through shame or fear, relabels evil actions as natural or good, and attempts to achieve an 'acceptable' balance in society. But it does not excise the core problems in the human heart, and we are never fully satisfied by any compromise. 

That is not to say, as some may assume I mean, that men cannot live better lives, or that we cannot, in some measure, achieve a better age for mankind. Nay, it seems only too probable that there will be times and places where goodness in humanity is honored and happiness is increased. What I mean is, that any such time, place, or society will never achieve a state of goodness that will fully satisfy, as evil will remain, if with lessened visibility.  

What one will always find in any good place is that, if only they would look a little closer, they would find all the evils of men sitting, if possible, even more comfortably in the background. Men and women will still lie to each other, they will still cheat their neighbor and on each other, except perhaps, in that time, such things will be seen as common and acceptable even when they cause irreparable damage to a loving soul. Selfishness and cruelty may be looked down on, but will still be enacted in private. Murders will occur, poverty persist, jealousy endure. 

Even in a perfect political kingdom, where all are given equal measure and all work toward the common good, you will find that human nature not banished but merely hidden behind walls of belief and philosophy, where behind it will still enact its hellish desires and pleasures. Moreover, that society, as all societies, is doomed to fail because any human construction is temporary, while human nature (until the coming of the Lord) is eternal and insatiable.

I do not need to ascribe to any particular philosophy or religion to know such things to be true, I need merely look at the entirety of written history to see how human action plays itself out. Futheremore I need not even look at history, I need only look at the selfish survival of nature. Looking at it from an evolutionary or ecological perspective, all things fight for their own survival and own good. That is the ruling notion of this world, and all ideas of goodness or hatred be nothing but flowers that rise and wilt beneath the weight of time, because our animal nature is one of selfishness, and good society is not a nature at all.

No matter how we feel about the selfish evil of men, whether as a root reality to be ignored, a reality to be accepted, or a reality to recognize as evil (as I do) we cannot change it by mere beliefs or human actions because the problem is not a belief or an action. The problem is who we are. For the truth is we are all evil and capable of doing all the sins we despise, nay, even the ones we think immune from. The ultimate despair is this: if we must love only what is good and hate what is evil, we must also hate ourselves. For we carry inside our hearts all the root causes for every contemptable sin. The action of evil deeds is only the outermost working of our evil hearts, and that even if any one man succeeds in holding back some of his demons, man will never stop failing in every conceivable way.

It is in this light that one can begin to understand the wisdom of God, how clearly he understands the nature of man. That all men carry a seemingly unkillable evil in their hearts, but yet he, the ultimate Good, loves men in spite of themselves.

"Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. This how God showed is love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. That is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God; but we love one another, God lives in us and his love made complete in us." 1 John 4:8-12

God's love, the love of Jesus Christ is entirely the opposite of the philosophy of loving what is good and hating what is evil. In contrast, God's love loves all men, the evil and the good, whose actions make no difference in God's love of them. And it is only this God and this love that can actually save the souls of men.  

This is why God's love is so difficult to understand to someone who believes in loving the good in men as opposed God's love of men. God, the originator of all goodness, Creator of the very weight in our hearts that tells us to resist evil, seemingly disregards evil and good, and loves men more than can be understood. This is God's love, the love that Jesus Christ shared. It is at the heart of the Good News, that by faith in Jesus Christ and his sacrifice on the Cross we have our sins forgiven, to be given eternal life, to be freed from our evil natures and made perfect in heaven, to be adopted into the heavenly family, and most of all, to know God the Creator of all as Father, brother and friend. 

Through this Gospel, this Good News the Lord gives us hope. But we are left with a fact, heavy as stone. God did not only save us, he give us new life, and that new life calls us to Love God, and to Love our neighbor as ourselves:

'One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?"

Jesus replied: 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments."' Matthew 22:34-40

The problem for all believers is this: to live out the fulfilling life that Christ has made available to us, we must embrace the fact that God is love, with all that that entails. We are called to know God, to love God with our innermost being. And subsequently, we are called to do the same for others. In our fallen state, we cannot do this. Nay, we are so far from being able to do it that we fail even making a beginning of such a trial on our own.   

How do I love God, who I only begin to know? And how can I love my neighbor, the miserable wretch, when I know he (and I) do not deserve love without condition? How can I love when my selfish heart still contains evil that trips me at every turn? How can I love my neighbor even when he does evil and is often unlovable? How can I live a love that I do not feel? 


The Secret of Discipleship
--------------------------
'Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heavon and on earth has been given to me. Therfore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."' Mark 28:18-20 

There is a secret, however, that most ignore in facing this problem: that God himself provides us a way to do this task and it is blatantly present in all four Gospels. We are to become disciples of Jesus Christ. That is, to accept Jesus as our teacher, to correct us and train us, to be like Him, as he is both the Son of Man, and Allmighty God. Living as a disciple of Jesus, as one saved by faith in Him, is the solution to the problem of learning to love.

Such a concept is so maddeningly obvious, but almost universally ignored. We ignore it because it is emminently hard, because the very concept is painful, and, secretly, because we know it would be a poison to following our earthly lifestyles. I myself can attest to all of this within my own life. 

The process seen in the Bible of Jesus and his disciples is like this:

- Jesus called his disciples to follow him 
    - There's lots of verses on this, gotta find best specifics
- Jesus taught his disciples and followers 
    - Versus on jesus teaching (THERE ARE SO MANY!)
    - How we can take the time to read his word and reflect 
- Jesus let his disciples ask questions, and He to answer them 
    - Supporting verses, both specific and physical examples, Jesus talking about our spirtual walk, and later new testament verses on this subject
    - Commune with God in prayer, and to listen to the Spirit, read the bible for answers
    - Also to include from other disciples who God speaks through (Jesus' hands and feet)
    - How to pray (Mathew 6:9-13)
- Jesus showed his disciples to take the lessons and attempt to follow through on the teaching 
    - Verses on obedience (lots of these, gotta find the best ones) 
    - Verses on how God both gives us strength and how God himself will do the impossible.

This process is repeated throughout Jesus' entire life of teaching. And the amazing thing is this, for both his disciples then and now, it works. Taking the time to separate ourselves from life to focus on God, to listen to his teachings, to think about those teachings and pray to God about them, and then to attempt to put them into practice, does what no one seems to expect (or at least, secretly fears): it works. The great Christian writers throughout history have attested to God's ability to change our hearts and lives, as they themselves say and show they have experienced it. Again, to my own wonder, I can also attest to all of this, within my own life, even from my earliest current practices, to my hope in the eventual flourishing of my life in God's eyes, that I am slowly but surely growing to love God more, and to love my neighbor more as well.

'"If you love me, you will obey what I command. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever-- the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, for he lives with you and will be in you. I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. On that day you will realize that am in my Father, and your are in me, and I am in you. Whoever has my commands and obeys them, he is the one who loves me. He who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love him and show myself to him."

Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, "But Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not the world?"

Jesus replied, "If anyone loves me, he will obey my teaching. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home in him. He who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who has sent me"'John 14:15-21 

Jesus sends the Holy Spirit to live within us, to counsel us in our actions. By becoming a disciple of Jesus, and learning to obey his commands, Jesus himself will show himself to us, more and more, and we will come to find that Jesus is inside of us, giving us new life, the life of God and love. In the most literal sense, we gain God within ourselves, who has and is the love we lack, changing us into the kinds of creatures that can love God, and love our neighbors as ourselves.

We do not just get the missing love in our life. We get God himself, to live in our very being and walk along side of us. This may sound like a trivial, or unnecessary distinction, but it makes all the difference in the world. Our reward for faith in Jesus is not just eternal life, for that is only a piece of the Good News. The gift of the Gospel is God himself.

This process is continuous, from silence and meditation, teaching, and subsequent prayer and prayerfully living. It is the miracle of Jesus' practice and teachings, that the practical effect of obedience to them is to grow new, impossible love for God and for our neighbor from the dead dust of the earth, as God breathes new life into his creation. 


In the following text I will attempt to clarify to practice this discipleship, how we can seek God's aid in letting go and gaining strength to begin our walk as disciples, and how God himself breathes his new life into us during this process.

[Note: Need a followup on how law and good society is still a necessity for human life this side of Heaven.]

Possible quotations to use:

"For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deed were evil. Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God." - John 3:17-21


My original description of the discipleship process (for a record in case I find I should put some of the old ideas back into the above or could use elsewhere):
1) Jesus separated his disciples and followers from unnecessary distractions
2) Jesus taught via illustrations and examples in front of the listeners 
3) Jesus let his disciples ask questions, and He to answer them
4) Jesus showed his disciples to meditate and pray on the teaching 
5) Jesus showed his disciples to take the lessons and prayerfully attempt to follow through on the teaching that Jesus spoke and God revealed in their hearts.

[Spiritual disciplines]
[Practical help to discipleship:
- following Jesus 
    - Spiritual disciplines as a reminder 
    - Confession and repentence from sin 
- listening to & learning from Jesus 
    - Establishing routine devotions (many forms of this) to focus ourselves on Jesus (and God's) teaching 
    - Spending time in communion with other disciples to focus, worship, and learn from God (many forms of this: sunday church, bible study, other things)
    - Separation from other things in our life so that we may listen and focus solely on Him (especially because we humans are so bad at listening to Him in the first place)
- communing with Jesus 
    - Prayer 
    - Listening
    - living life prayerfully (walking as one with God in all parts of our life, both when conscious of Him and when unconscious of him)
- obedience to Jesus 
    - Identifying where we fall short of what Jesus asks of us 
    - Praying for the strength to follow through 
    - Praying for the strength to pray for the strength to follow through 
    - Giving up those parts of ourselves
    - Attempting to follow through]

[Important things to learn from God 
- God's grace 
- God's mercy]

[Things I have learned through personal communion with God:
That God understands that this is process *is a process*, that we are willfully sinful and fight against him. What is important is we pray for strength to overcome each sin in our life, especially our will to sin, and that we give each part of ourselves into God's keeping as works our souls and gives us the strength to do so.

Do not be overworried about how long this process takes, to apply God's *personal* grace and mercy to our own lives, as this is really how God wants to treat us, with mercy and grace. (need to deal with common perceptions of God as being "merciful" and "graceful", except not really)

To listen as God constantly calls us back to him.]

[The Spirit of God: it is not what we do that matters, what matters to God is that we are *with* Him and with each other (parable of the prodigal son). We do what God asks so that we may be more with Him.]

[Leftovers, possible for a chapter on pain] 

To many, this concept is more terrifying than a God without love or no God at all. We instictually retract from knowing a love such as this, as every inner child has struggled with to one degree or another, because of the pain it brings, and the fear that such a love my betray us.

"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
- Jesus Christ, Mathew 27:46 & Mark 15:34 

That is, God is not the type of being to hurt us in the ways that we have been hurt in our pasts. God will never betray us, unlike the people around us. Indeed, every action God takes, even ones that look like such a betrayal, ultimately compound to such a devastatingly deep understanding of our human life that it cannot be understood. 

This truth of God's love, and that all his actions come from His love, is so true that it is impossible to easily explain to someone experiencing pain and loss (which God, of course, is allowing in their life). This problem can be seen addressed by the very greatest masterworks in any age, including the Bible itself. Jesus's Crucifixtion, The book of Job, [further examples], each deal directly with this problem of immense, unfathomable, and unearned pain in the life of men. (further helpful examples: The problem of pain (CS Lewis), A grief Observed (CS Lewis)). I myself will not endevour to cover in detail the deep and troubling problem of pain our lives, I leave that to others (as pointed to by previous examples. I encourage any reader who is struggling with this issue to pursue said examples). In my own life it has been enough to discover that all issues do melt away when presented with the face of God. 
"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." John 3:16 

Nevertheless, it is true that God's actions and innermost being are of love, even when they seem like hate. In fact, most often a person cannot truly understand that God loves them *until* they have experienced pain and hate. This is the reversal of the pain of childhood love of their earthly parents, that God's love is the love of the heavenly parent, the actual complemenent to our earthly first love that our own earthly parents could not satisfy: 1 Corinthians 13:4-5: “Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs."
