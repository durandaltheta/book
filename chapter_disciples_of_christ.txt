Agape love, is love that does not depend on any positive feature and is equally unihibited by any flaw in the target of its love. 


Agape love can only be rarely found in men, so much so that it tends to be found most often in the earliest moments of life, when we are closer chronologically to our most direct interaction with God, from conception through early childhood. It manifests in our strange attachment to our parents, and often to a lesser degree, our siblings. Even when said love gives way to being twisted into or laboring under anger, it is not less an unusual fluctuation in the emotional natures of men simply because we can see how much anger can be generated from that love. 

This love is often our earliest emotional concept and it is in complete contradiction to everything life naturally teaches men later on, that we love a thing because it is good and hate a thing because it is bad. This first love, in contrast, simply loves, so much so that we will defend the object of it by doing things that we know is often completely foreign to that love: adopting whatever behaviors, attitudes, and general spirit our parents. In such a way we learn to be and do things that have no original connection to our first love, and how all the misery of mankind is transmitted throughout history. 

Strange, is it not, that so much of our successes and failures , all our crimes and innovations have at some root, no matter the remote date, so often originate from simple parental love.

Many of us who have had extremely damaging effects from this interaction, often through abuse and negative behaviors of our parents and close family, have to spend a lifetime undoing the work that was done in only a few short years in order to achieve health. This is why virtually everyone alive has defensive walls, learned in childhood, to defend against too close an attachment to others around us. We become so insulated, that we can no longer feel and, indeed, can all too often no longer develop unconditional love at all.

This is a core issue that every Christian believer must address, that our God is the God of unconditional agape love. A love that loves us in spite of any sin and unimproved by any improvement in ourselves. To many, this concept is more terrifying than a God without love or no God at all. We instictually retract from knowing a love such as this, as every inner child has struggled with to one degree or another, because of the pain it brings, and the fear that such a love my betray us.

What is different about God's love, and is something that many hear but cannot understand, is that our God has love similar to our earliest love (and is, in fact, the source of it) but is perfectly capable and at home in such a state. That is, God is not the type of being to hurt us in the ways that we have been hurt in our pasts. That is, God will never betray us, as we have so often been betrayed by the object of our love. Indeed, every action God takes, even ones that look like such a betrayal, ultimately compound to such a devastatingly deep understanding of our human life that it cannot be understood. 


"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
- Jesus Christ, Mathew 27:46 & Mark 15:34 

This truth of God's love, and that all his actions come from His love, is so true that it is impossible to easily explain to someone experiencing pain and loss (which God, of course, is allowing in their life). This problem can be seen addressed by the very greatest masterworks in any age, including the Bible itself. Jesus's Crucifixtion, The book of Job, [further examples], each deal directly with this problem of immense, unfathomable, and unearned pain in the life of men. (further helpful examples: The problem of pain (CS Lewis), A grief Observed (CS Lewis)) 

Nevertheless, it is true that God's actions and innermost being are of love, even when they seem like hate. In fact, most often a person cannot truly understand that God loves them *until* they have experienced pain and hate. 

The core problem for all believers is this: to live out the fulfilling life that Christ has made available to us, we must embrace the fact that God is love, with all that that entails. We are called to know God, to love God with our innermost being, inspite of the potential for unlimited pain. And subsequently, we are called to do the same for others. In our fallen state, we cannot do this. Nay, we are so far from being able to do it that we fail even making a beginning of such a trial on our own. 

There is a secret, however, that most ignore in facing this problem: that God himself provides us a way to do this task and it is blatantly present in all four Gospels. We are to become Disciples of Jesus Christ. That is, to accept Jesus as our teacher, to correct us and train us, to be like Him, as he is both the Son of Man, and Allmighty God. 

Such a concept is so maddeningly obvious, but almost universally ignored. We ignore it because it is emminently hard, because the very concept is painful, and, secretly, because we know it would be a poison to following our earthly lifestyles. I myself can attest to all of this within my own life. 

The process seen in the Bible of Jesus and his disciples is like this:

1) Jesus separated his disciples and followers from unnecessary distractions
2) Jesus taught via illustrations and examples in front of the listeners 
3) Jesus let his disciples ask questions, and He to answer them
4) Jesus showed his disciples to meditate and pray on the teaching 
5) Jesus showed his disciples to take the lessons and prayerfully attempt to follow through on the teaching that Jesus spoke and God revealed in their hearts.


This process is repeated throughout Jesus' entire life of teaching. And the amazing thing is this, for both his disciples then and now, it works. Taking the time to separate ourselves from life to focus on God, to listen to his teachings, to think about the teachings and pray to God about them, and then to attempt to put them into practice, does what no one seems to expect (or at least, secretly fears): it works. The great Christian writers throughout history have attested to God's ability to change our hearts and lives, as they themselves say and show they have experienced it. Again, to my own wonder, I can also attest to all of this, within my own life, from my earliest current practices of this regiment, to my hope in the eventual flourishing of my life in God's eyes, that I am slowly but surely growing to love God more, and to love my neighbor more as well.

This process is continuous, from silence and meditation, teaching, and subsequent prayer and prayerfully living. It should be no shock that such a practical method would achieve practical results. What is a shock, is that this process, for many the first time since birth, to cause true, God borne love to grow again in our hearts. This is the miracle of Jesus' practice and teachings, that the practical effect of them is to grow new, impossible love for God and for our neighbor from the dead dust of the earth.
